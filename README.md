# Breast-Cancer-Classification-With-Neural-Network

![breast_cancer_classification_dataset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71970250/188055612-8a2465bd-cd21-4d00-9737-b68b41e1493f.jpg)

The dataset is directly import from sklearn module.

0 and 1 are used to predict whether a person have a brain tumor or not in the following way:

● 0 --> The brain tumor is Benign

● 1 --> The brain tumor is Malignant 

The libraries used here are Tensorflow and Keras.

The prgram then divides the dataset into training and testing samples in 80:20 ratio randomly using train_test_split() function available in sklearn module.

Accuracy score is then calculated by comparing with the correct results of the training dataset.
